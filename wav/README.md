This folder contain audio samples created by running LiveSPICE circuits in the LiveSPICE VST on dry guitar recordings from https://github.com/mikeoliphant/DryGuitarSamples.

All samples have "Clean" versions, which use the dry sample with the LiveSPICE effect disabled, but all other effects (speaker cabinet simulation, reverb, etc.) the same.
